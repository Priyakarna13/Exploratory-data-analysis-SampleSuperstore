# Exploratory-data-analysis-SampleSuperstore


The goal here is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ with the help of python libraries i.e. matplotlib, plotly, plotnine and seaborn.

Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl.

The sales of a superstore is analysed using exploratory data analysis to identify the patterns of sale and weak areas to improve the overall profits of the store.

A use case where a business manager, is trying to find out the weak areas and also explore business problems and insights that could be derived by the data.
